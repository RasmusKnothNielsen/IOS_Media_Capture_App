# IOS_Media_Capture_App

Repo containing work done for the mandatory assignment week 13 of the IOS Course at Computer Science, KEA.

Right now, the app supports:
- Taking pictures with the camera and displaying them in the app.
- Resizing the pictures to smaller dimmensions to save space.
- Adding desired text to images.
- Saving images by swiping them to the right.
- Deleting images by swiping them to the left.
- Taking video with the camera. (Still need to implement showing the video in the app)
